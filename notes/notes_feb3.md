# HOUSE OF USHER:

## Student Remarks:

 - 80% description. You become lost in the HOUSE and you become lost in the VOCABULARY. Note: It's hard to understand because a lot of it is normal for the time of writing (1839), yet a lot of it is just rarely used vocab
 - A big part of this text is taking physical descriptions (architecture, people, etc) and interpreting them metaphorically (Ex: In Usher's room. people who enter can't see whole room, yet usher can. Connects to the idea of a patriarch of the family having eyes on everyone)
 - Lady madeleine is seen walking, then it is said that she is dead. This puts the burden of determining whether she is dead/ghost or alive on the reader (up for interpretation)

## Description of the house:

These are the physical details mentioned in the story

 - Mostly stable but broken in each individual brick,
 - "Zigzag fissure"/crack 
 - Antiquated furniture
 - Eye-like window
 - Rotten wood 
 - Multiple staircases
 - Hidden passageways
 - Heavy curtains and drapes
 - Fungi growing on the outside
 - Trees are dying
 - Dungeon basement (Secrets of the house)
 - Big iron door in dungeon basement
 - GOTHIC/Early Victorian
 - Big lake (Called a tarn, a lake with black swampy water)
 - The house is very creaky (You can hear EVERYTHINGðŸ˜›)

 ## Group Questions I:

1. **Why has the narrator come to the House of Usher?**

- The narrator goes to see Roderick (narrator's childhood friend) who sends a letter to the narrator to keep him company during his sickness. Roderick calls narrator his best friend even though they only knew each other for a brief moment while they were boys. Roderick calls narrator at the very end of his life (Why do people confront their problems too late?)

2. **How does the narrator describe Roderick's personality? How does he describe his physical and mental states?**

- Weird. Roderick's behavior goes from confident to reserved. Seems depressed. Roderick is passionate about the arts, music, literature, etc. Contrasted by the melancholy of his condition.
- He looks fragile, weak. Looks like he's dying. His eyes droop, are shiny. Hair is very thin, used to be thick (compared to a web). Pale. 
- All of this is very similar to how the house is described. Certain words (Roderick "ghastly") are used to describe the house and Roderick.

3. **What do we learn about the Usher family, its history and background? What does Roderick tell the narrator is ailing him?**

- The Usher has an interest in the arts. Ushers are an incestuous family line since they are said to have never moved far from the house and that they have a "direct line of descent" (never branched out). The house has always been identified with the family => the house IS the family and vice-versa
- Is really sensitive to light and smells. Special clothing must be worn since regular clothes irritate him. Something psychological is happenning within Roderick's mind? Poe is exploring the psychological?

4. **Who is Madeline?What disease does she suffer from?**

- Everything for Roderick is too much, whereas the sister is described more passive. She is the exact opposite. She is barely there. Parallel between them since they are twins.

5. **So far, what strikes you as potentially "Gothic" about these opening remarks and scenes?**

- Patriarchy, money, wealth
- Constant repetition (bloodline, inbreeding)(watch for repetition!!)
- The House: Castle-y, old, been there for a good minute, crumbling (Poe hinting at old colonial values being on the way out in the modern US?)
- Familial issues

## Bad things that happen to the family because of the inbreeding: 
- Illness because of inbreeding ("It was a constitutional and family evil")
- Social consequences are that the family becomes antisocial. Perhaps Poe is suggesting that antisocial behavior can be unhealthy for societies. Critiquing how the aristocrats of Europe keep their bloodlines pure? The only good things that come from this though is that wealth, status, power can be accumulated.
- Perhaps part of Usher's mental illness is that to continue the Usher legacy he must have children with his sister which gives him a lot of anxiety.
