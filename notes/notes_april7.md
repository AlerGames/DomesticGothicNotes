# PRE-ESSAY RECAP

## Writing about the movies
Allowed to use a double-sided cheat sheet (give detailed descriptions of scenes you plan to use as evidence)

BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE WHEN PRESENTING EVIDENCE FROM THE FILM (when doing a small recap it isn't too important to be in detail)

Ex: "We see the wallpaper splitting, the camera zooms in for tension, cockroaches spill out"

No need for timestamps.

## Breath from the Depths (Supermarket)
The supermarket scene is a good candidate for close reading.

When she saw her child in someone else she wet herself (she hsa been trying to avoid him, but confronting him was simply too much).

Lola starts judging the mother, however since Lola sees her son in the lady's kid, she subconsciously associates herself to the lady. When insulting the lady, Lola's insulting herself. (PROJECTION)

Incontinence (peeing herself, connects to the gothic idea of excess)

Lola tries to contain things (boxes, lists, etc) to stay in control and avoid her suffering. Her Incontinence is a lack of control.

Likens her ressemblance to the lady to a "trick of mirrors"

## Breath from the Depths (The boy)
The boy is THE symbol of transgression (ENTERS/BREACHES THE HOUSE) as opposed to supermarket scene where there's an excess (urine) that leaks out.

Smashed "mirrors", note that the previous scene (supermarket) connects her perception of herself to mirrors. This could insinuate that mirrors represent her preception of herself. Broken mirror = broken self-preception (because of trauma associated to guilt)

AFTER TODAY: THINK UP WHAT YOU WANT YOUR CLAIM TO BE. Ex: DONT SAY THAT THE STORY IS ABOUT GRIEF/TRAUMA, SAY WHAT YOU THINK AUTHOR WAS SAYING ABOUT GRIEF/TRAUMA

## Creating a thematic claim practice
Toxic masculinity in <u>The Shining</u>
dangers of past deals

People are good at this (all theme no claim):
S. Kubrick uses symbols to show the themes of toxic masculinity + the dangers of outdated ideals.

Announces two themes, toxic masculinity / dangers of outdated ideals and shows device. Connects the device and the theme.

HOWEVER, you need a follow up sentence to explain what the author is saying about toxic masculinity. this is your **INTERPRETATION** of the theme. Don't be scared to push it too far, better to teeter on that line. Use language that has connotations. (denounce, reinforces, calls out, etc.)

## Essay structure
Intro:
Topic -> Scope -> These Statement (thematic claim) (what the whole paper is trying to prove)

Body Paragraph(s):
Topic sentence (Thematic Claim) (taking a chunk of the statement to deal with) -> Evidence
Close reading analysis (detail, deice, specificity)

Conclusion:
Symmarize major points (1-3 sentences)

Example of the difference:
