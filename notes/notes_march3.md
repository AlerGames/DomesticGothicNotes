# THE TURN OF THE SCREW

## Meta
The teacher will have at least one question that basically is: "what do the ghosts mean?"
The teacher will prolly have at least one question that basicall is "whats the meaning of the house (DOMESTIC gothic)"

16-20 is one block that focus heavily on Flora. Reproduces a lot of the same themes and patterns from previous chapters.

## CH 16
The governess resolveds to contact the uncle about what has been happening. Who should be the one to write to him, according to her and Mrs.Grose?
What do we learn about Mrs. Grose in this exchange? Is this information relevant?
When does the governess say she will write to the uncle?
## CH 17
The governess stands outside Miles' door in the night, listening for any movement inside. He catches her at the door. What do they talk about? (good citation for paranoia)
Anything Miles says seems to be interpreted by the governess as meaning something more. What presumptions is she making?
How does the conversation suggets miscommunication perhaps more than communication? Does this relate to some of thenovel's othe rmajor ideas?
She is caught by Miles, shows governess' waining power.
## CH 18
The chapter starts off with the governess assuring Mrs. Grose she has written to the uncle. What does she not tell Mrs. Grose about this letter? (Governess didn't actually send the letter yet; she is lying, letters are a good symbol for controlling people, restricting information; james is interested in how communication works and how it breaks down (the whole novel is a game of broken telephone))
The chapter starts off with the governess assuring Mrs. Grose she has written to the uncle. What does she not tell Mr.s Grose abou tthis letter?
After bumping into Mr.s Grose in the hallway, the governess, who cannot seem to place iehter Miles or Flora, speculates about where they might be. Where does she think they have respectively gone off to.
## CH 19
## CH 20
Right after questioning Flora about Miss Jessel's location (to which the little girl looks confused, a confusion which, in turn, is interpreted by the governess  as complicity), the governess claims to see MIss Jessel standing exactly where she did earlier, on the other end of the lake. She is "relieved", albint terrified, to see this vision, since it finally confirms the "realness" of the ghosts before the eyes of other witnesses. And yet, how do Flora and Mrs. Grose react?
In particular, as the govreness presses her point and insists on Miss Jessel's presence,  how does Mrs. Grose intercede? What does she say to Flora?
Flora asks to leave and to be removed from the governess' presence. It seems now that the governess has becom ethe diturbing presence that, in theory, Miss Jessel, as a ghost, was in the governss' mind. It is her (the governess) who is caushing the idstress. Alone, on the other side of the lake, who does the governess remind us of, standing there?
The governess loses power when Mrs Grose keeps Flora away from her when they both cannot see the ghosts.
NO OBJECTIVE TRUTH IN THIS BOOK,  EVERYTHING IS A MATTER OF PERSPECTIVE (FLORA DOESNT SEE JESSEL, GOVERNESS DOES)
Can argue that the reality is as the governess sees and that the other's just aren't listening to her testimony.
Mrs grose is able to take away the governess' power cuz she decides gov doesnt deserve it, which indicates that the only reason that governess has power is that grose allows it. Despite this, the class system theyre trying to take power in keeps hurting them.
Governess' power is never actually used. All she does is scare the kids using it. What's it actually used?
Governess is always compared to the ghosts, maybe this is to indicate how SHE's the scary thing in the house.
## CH 21
The next day, Mrs Grose visists the governess and informs her that Flora has taken a dangerous fever, perhaps brought on by the fear and excitement of the previous afternoon. It is clear that the governess wishes again to push her interpretation of events and even seem sto believe that Mrs. Frose is still "on her side".
How does the governess now interpret her own version of events (re: Quint and Jessel)?
The person with the least power, least literacy (mrs Grose) is better at analyzing and maneuvering situations than the governess. How come the class system gives gov more power?
## CH 22
Flora leaves with Mrs Grose to be taken to her uncle.
The governess and miles are left alone. They avoid each other in the house but, eventually, sit down for dinner. Miles declares "were all alone now, except for them" (miles implies that the maids and servants are nobodies)
## CH 23
in response to miles' statement that they are "alone" the governess says that they are not completely alone. Miles agrees and mentions "the others" in the house. Maybe he means quint and jessel; maybe he simply means the other maids and servants (who, as miles puts it "dont much count , do they?")
## CH 24
The same conversation continues. In the middle of it, the governess believes Peter Quint has entered the room. She continues to question Miles about the letter and, finally, he admits that he took it and that he read it, wanting to see what she said about him. There was nothing in the letter, he confesses, and he burnt it.
This can be a way of saying that by withdrawing the letter she just THOUGHT she had power, yet master Miles was acutally the one with the power. This whole time. The class system as it is is will put you down when you try to climb.
Miles dies lol
Could be interpreted as having to kill the heirs in the class system for it not to continue on
The only possible "proof" that the ghosts are real is Miles' last line of dialogue.

## ESSAY REVISION

### POE
Possible interpretation is that Poe(author) uses destruction of house as symbol(device) for family secret. Shows us that repressing secrets inevitably leads to destruction and the secrets coming back up (claim).
Themes: Gothic atmosphere; house; rooms; dungeon/vault (buyring secrets); psychology = repression / burying; family secrete; incest taboo; tedious descriptions of the house; Madeleine -> bury her as she symbolizes the family incest secret; mirror for roderigue: he is burrying his own mortality + complicity in family secret; aritocratic lineage (purity) (the bloodlinebeing nastied up)
Devices: House as symbol for themes; destruction of house (symbolic for family)

### JAMES
Themes: Class system; power; gender; psychology; repression; projection; sublimation(when you feel bad about something ur doing/notdoing and twist it in your head to make it sound good), innocence => a mask for evil things (be careful regarding innocence, make sure you have a proper claim)
Devices:

### LAST PIECE OF ADVICE
You're not responsible about the entirety of the text. Choose one aspect and HONE in on it. Try to find two scenes that are the best for that specific idea. Do some close reading (whats the device) beforehand.
