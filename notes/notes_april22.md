# HILL HOUSE

## INTRODUCTION / EXPOSITION (pp.1-9)
"rain of stones" (history of paranormal) / father's death

## ROAD TRIP (pp. 9-19)
lions/oleaders/hat => love, protection, care = mother "gross old lady"

luke: (he's a thief and a liar, a screwup) was chosen to watch over the group. he's going to inherit the house

theodora (psychic): had an argument with her friend (roommate or more??) which is why she chose to go

dialogue => "weird"/layers, talking about different things at once while talking about the same thing, joking or not joking, not listening to each other

interesting: acting like someone isn't there even when they are = acting like they're a ghost.

Mrs. Dudley: "if you scream at the middle of the night no one will help you", repetitive speech (automation like a robot), says that she agrees to this, but doesn't mention to WHO she agreed, lack of identification ("ghostly"), different speeches/interacion

pairs of women fighing are very present in the story, recurring motif
pairs of women being driven together/apart also is a recurring motif

eleanor is very stunted, childish, (cup of stars scene with the kid where she was telling her not to part with it)

when eleanor stopped at the second dinner she kept wondering if doc would approve, which says a lot about her personality (submissive, looking for parental approval)

doc is set up as a father figure (gives direction, reads book to guests before bed)

eleanor sees a child's face on the person knocking at the door.

eleanor sees the house as evil, vile when pulling up in the driveway. Theo merely sees it as antiquated and old
