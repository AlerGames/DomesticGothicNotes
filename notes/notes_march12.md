# THE SHINING

In the essay you can use a different set of devices if you wish (camera, sound, etc) since it's a movie. The next 3 texts/films are explicitely about families. The scary stuff is a metaphor for family tension and family disfunction. 

## EARLY PART OF THE FILM
Jack is trying to charm the hotel manager in a specific way. This contrasts how he exists with his family. 

The hotel is built on an indigenous burrial ground. Connects the hotel to american colonialism and genocide. "we had to clear off the space and fight for it" from the movie. Turns jack's toxicity into the toxicity of america! Hotel decor is appropriated from natives symbolism and desings. Luxury hotel people come to see the landscape of the people that were killed so that the hotel could be used by colonisers. Take the land, appropriate the culture, use it for profit.

The hotel is called the overlook -> Jack looks over the maze during the scenes of him writing. Transitions to the maze where it transitions to the actual maze where his wife and danny are. This means that Jack is trying to get power over these people.

The elevator blood scene might represent the blood that was spilled. (vision that was given to danny by shining (of the future) )

The girls that danny sees are the family of the former caretaker. Danny sees their bodies. TReflects what his own fate might be. "Play with us forever and forever" -> Jack also says "forever and forever" which could be a valuable association to make.

Caretaker -> taking care -> jack sees the former caretaker and is told to correct family (just like the former caretaker did). "You've been the caretaker forever" means that jack has always been "taking care" of his family and trying to get them in line.

## HOW THE FILM WAS MADE
Some scenes that were 30 seocnds long were shot like 100 times. Film seems to critique men like jack and the structures that give them power (social, family structures). However, the making of the film saw an obsessive and controlling man (Stanley Kubrick) take power over people

Film is based on a book from 1977 from stephen king. The rights to the book were purchased by kubrick while he was still big and stephen king was still smaller since his past few hadn't made a lot of money. The book still wasn't published. King wrote a screeplay and presented it to kubrick, got ghosted by kubrick.

From the beginning there was tension between the two. Kubrick didn't want King to be involved at all. 

The film is quite different between the book. The messages communicated by the two are very diff apparently. 

Book: A guy is struggling with things and the hotel brings them out
Movie: A guy is already like this and the hotel brings them out  

In the book he was struggling against something whereas in the movie he is already bad.

Kubrick had the hotel built which cost insane amounts of money. Especially considering the exact same hotel already existed in colorado. None of the cast knew anyone in england, but had to spend a year in england. 6 days a week 6am to 10pm or something. Certain techniques were partially invented on set. (steady cam)

cherry duval said that the shining ruined her film career and that it was horrible (past). now says that it wasnt that bad but that it ruined her career (now)

kubrick made everyone not talk to duval and mad eher do scenes over and over again to get her to go insane and capture that one camera.

the assistant movie script writer was a gothic litterature professor at first.
