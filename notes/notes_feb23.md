# THE TURN OF THE SCREW
## CH 7-10
Jessel + Quint (affair, major taboo because of the class difference, jessel was higher in the house than quint): 
Jessel: "infamous", "lady", unmarried yet was with quint (sexual taboo, a "fallen" woman)
Quint: "hound", "too free", "had his way with them all"


Irony: Q+J are immoral and demonized, yet have similar dynamic to what the governess fantasizes about (her own class-crossing relationship with unc)

## CH 9

Governess sees Jessel crying at the bottom of the stairs, calls her "horror, dishonored, miserable woman". Notice the spacial dynamics, governess was physically above Jessel.

Quint first appeared on the tower, then through the window, then on the stairs below governess and next to a window. Window is nice symbolism, can see through and also look at yourself at the same time (pertinent because she went outside and took quints place outside the window). used to be on the same level as the window but is now above it which shows her change in mentality.

another reading could be that the governess is projecting (her own guilts and moral anxieties are projected onto jessel and quint) Ex: fantasy of marrying above her social position => projects onto jessel and quints dynamic. instead of thinking about her fears about now protecting the children => projects onto jessel being a bad governess and not protecting the children & quint being a hound that is infecting the kids

## CH 10 "prank"

the prank is
flora is at a window looking at the garden wheres miles is. the governess goes to a different window and looks down at miles from that other window. miles is not looking back at any of them. is looking above. governess assumes it is quint that he is looking at.

thinking that you see someone else seeing something ties to how the story is a broekn game of telephone.

in that scene miles may have been the one with the most power. had the most control over the situation since he was the only one that could see everything "i did it because i could"

## CH 11

This chapter initiates a new dymanic between the governess and miles. before going back to bed, miles confesses that he purposefuly pulled the prank and went out on the lawn in order to show the governess that he "could" be "bad"

what does he mean by this? is he looking for attention, acting out solely to elicit a reaction from the governess and secure her affection - an understandable thing for a recetnly orphaned boy to do? or is he being serious and suggesting that, if he wants to, he can be far less "angelic" than the governess seems to believe?

for her prat, the governess is "charmed" by Miles and his mischievousness - another kind of "boys will be boys" reaction that seems to play into some of the gender norms and assumptions the book returns to from time to time

"badness" and "goodness" are flexible and are dependant on social constructs (quint being bad => he should die, miles bad => just a wittle boy, unc being bad => "i wanna be seduced by him too")

who is the corrupting influence on miles? (is it the uncle? quint? whats worse for him, the class system that teaches him that hes allowed to be "too free" or whatever quint was doing)

governess is becoming a disturbance in the the house by being overprotecting the kids

## CH 12 "theyre only seen across, as it were, and beyond - in strnage places and high places..."

the book deals with liminal spaces (spaces between spaces (stairs, halls)), the ghosts are liminal (between living and dying). the book is always in between meaning, much like the liminal spaces. asking the reader to make a determination

in temrs of passages that are ripe for close reading and interpretive analysis, this is one of the best chapters in the novel! it starts off with the governess more or less admitting that she might be going "crazy" (her word) but then dismissing this and, oddly, saying that whatever she's experiencing it's only making her "more lucid"

on the next page, she gives an interesting decription of how the "ghosts" only appear in in-between places within te house: across thingsl, around windows and doors, staircase, etc... we might ourselves interpret these positions and placements as meaningful. **what could they suggest thematically?**

finally, the chapter ends with an important decision (or declaration) on the governess' part. Acting more lucidly than the governess. Mrs. Grose suggests they cntact the uncle since something is cleraly happening (either with the ghosts or with the governess). The governess dismisses this idea in the staunchest terms: if Mrs.Grose presses the point, she will leave, on the spot.

is one of the only times grose challenges the governess. grose is getting worried about the governess.

the boarding schol that miles wants to go back to is filled with people of his own class

## CH 13 "the place... was like a theatre after the performance..."

no ghost sightings, no more ghosts: here are REAL problems. gothic always uses formula that something supernatural is a metaphor for something real

this chapter slows down the sightings, with, as the governess puts it, the house and estate now "like a theatre after the performance." yet again, this is an interesting choice of words, and what seems striking about this chapter is how, despite the lack of ghostly appearances or events, this only leads the governess into further speculation. she starts to believe for example that whatever she has seen in the past is probably only a small portion of what the children have seen over time. in other words, the chapter seem sto purposely stop the sightings while also suggesting the power of the imagination to picture worse things still.

governess says that all contact in the house must go through her: one of the first evidence of abusive behavior

pathetic fallacy: when the weather is matching the mood / theme (the weather is gloomy to reflect how things arent going the best in the story)

scary things are the class system and the sexual taboos of the time, but the governess instead reinforces the class system and points at the "ghosts" as the root of the problems

## CH 14 "the way im going on..."

here, miles confronts the governess about why he isn't going back to school, as the two walk to church on sunday morning.

the scene parallels the several conversations between the governess and mrs gorse, insofar as it is less a conversation (or exchange or thoughts and ideas) and a series of missed opportunities and blanks

both miles and the governess allude to what the other knows and suggest that the other knows something that they don't. and yet, it's never quite clear what either of them is referring to. infact, the only thing this scene/conversation does clarity is a lack of communication: that the governess has not contacted the uncle about any of this; that Miles does not know what went wrong at school; that the governess does not either.

given the frustrations of this situation, miles forces the governess' hand, declaring that if she will not contact his uncle then he will

wants to protect miles innocence by not letting him know that he's been expelled from school (overprotecting, overbearing)

"i dont think your uncle cares very much about you" to Miles

if there are ghosts in the house, why not just send them to school? (could indicate that there aren't really any ghosts)

end of scene they are walking back to church (moral authority telling you what's good and what's wrong in your life)

# CH 15

Miles' declaration is real occasion for the governess to get mad at him. but notice the irony of this fact: whereas before it was unclear what he had done that was "bad", now the bad thing he has positively done is declare an intention to contact his legal guardian and relative about clarifying what exactly is going on.

the chapter is notable for the way in which, towards its second half, itvisually echoes the earlier scene of miss jessel (or somebody) at the foot of the stairs, crumpled over with their head in their hands: now, the governess is in this exact same position

this visual echo suggets a thematic one as well: like the sighting through the window, the governess is liek one of the ghosts. Perhaps this suggests her own insubstantiality. Perhaps, it suggests the "cycle" we talked about last class - that is, how it is almost impossible for someone in her position *not* to become ghostly,frustrated, distraught.

emphasizing this point, the chapter concludes with a further sighting in the schoolroom where jessel has "taken" the governess's place at the school table, again suggesting a parallel between the two women. look closely at the word choices here, with the governess referring to jessels apparition as a "miserable" woman who is "dishonored and tragic" these words seem to reflect back on the governess herself, is she projecting onto these visoin of jessel, seeing a version of herself according to her?

FOR THE BODY PARAGRAPHS WE HAVE TO THREAD TOGETHER A COUPLE OF SCENES AND MOEMNTS WHERE WE CAN CONNECT THINGS

this chapter continues from a scene where miles challenges the power of the governess. the challenging manifests an apparition

schoolroom scene is ripe with symbolism

for the third time, jessel is described as a miserable woman, dishonored, tragic (almost as if shes talking about how she feels about herself

schoolroom is a purposeful choice. it is a space of power in the 1800s. it is where she has her authority instead of it being governess' schoolroom, it has been infiltrated.
