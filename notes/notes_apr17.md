## SHIRLEY JACKSON
<ul>
<li>Gothic + "domestic writing"</li>
<li>"The Lottery (1948)"</li>
<li>Geraldine Jackson (mother), from the beginning wanted sherly to be a "normal young woman". Geraldine directly told Shirley "you're not the kind of daughter i wanted" "If i had known you would turn out like this I would not have gone through with the preganancy". Makes Shirley feel like she wasn't "normal". Shirley talked to her mother every single day even when she for new york to attend college (she grew up in cali)</li>
<li>Shirley was the BREADWINNER of her family. Sold the film rights for Hill House at a record price. Was legit famous. Said shit like "yeah im a witch" on national television.</li>
<li>had to juggle writing career and woman's responsibilities</li>
<li>Stanley Hymon (husband)</li>
<li>her husband said that he wouldn't be faithful (had affairs with her friends), said that he wouldn't do any domestic work. However, he was supportive of her writing (maybe because she made money?)...</li>
<li>Her water breaks and husband refuses to bring her to hospital. Nurse writes down that she was "housewife" instead of "writer" (even though she is Shirley mf jackson)</li>
<li>Geraldine wrote "when will you ever stop writing books about demented girls" in a letter to Shirley (girls who are demented by whom???)</li>
<li>Shirley might be using the gothic (weaponizing tropes of the gothic) to depict her real life experiences</li>
<li>Shirley dies of a heart attack (was a heavy smoker / drinker + took diet pills which at the time were amphetamines (hard drugs!))

## CH1
Find the pages where these quotes are from. Read the few sentences around the quote and point out things that are interesting / weird.
<ul>
<li>small guilts & reproaches p.3 Took care of her mother for 11 years. "Spent so long wiht no one to love". Yet, she feels a sense of guilt. What is Eleanor feeling guilty about? Using the words "small" shows that it is a cumulative psychic trauma. Eleanor can't even face sunlight with who reclusive she had to be to take care of her mom. The only person she hates, NOW THAT HER MOM IS DEAD, is her sister. (MOTHER DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, SO ELEANOR FEELS GUILTY ABOUT HER HATE) The norm is that a good daughter should take care of her mother, so she cannot let out her emotions because it makes her feel bad. "ugly feelings" (Sian Nghi) are feelings we identify as ugly even though they aren't ACTUALLY so.'</li>
<li>stone lions p.12 Represent status and protection. Having a house and having lions is status. Lions can protect.</li>
<li>"Mother would agree with me" Even though Eleanor is the one that took care of mother, sister says that mother would agree with her. Means that mother prefers sister. The fact that mother has to rely on Eleanor makes mother resent Eleanor. The horror of the novel so far isn't supernatural, it is very realistic. (cannot attain mother's love)</li>
<li>Woodcutter hut</li>
<li>queen waits, weeping p.13  Fantasy. Symbol for wanting mother's love and approval. mother / daughter relationship. Belonging or being "different". This contradiction is represented with the images/symbols of Eleanor's temptations</li>
<li>soup + oatmeal</li>
<li>cup of stars. Symbol for uniqueness. Doesn't want the girl not to drink her milk wihtout the cup of stars so that the little girl can retain her uniqueness. Feels too emotional over a small cause because of her prior experiences</li>
<li>cheesecake</li>
<li>oleanders p.13 Pink flower that is poisonous. Represents traditional femininity. Wants to run away but also wants to fit in</li>
</ul>
